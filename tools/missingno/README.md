# Challenge I

Run the solution with:
```
python sandbox.py
```
Dumps containing the sprite/chunks can be found in the current directory afterwards.

Run the tests with:
```
pytest
```

Other fun things:
- `decompress.py` - partial decompressor written to figure out the sprite decompression algorithm
- `differential.py` - differential encoder/decoder
- `generatecases.py` - generate test cases for diff encoder/decoder tests
- `pokechars.py` - convert from poke charset
